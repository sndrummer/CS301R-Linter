1. Create 2 files that fit the description of crap you need to figure out, use switch statement and maybe else
2. Implement a Visitor for the first one, that checks and sees if there are too many switch statements
    * To do this just look at the VisitorNode implementation, basically use
        visit(ifStatement node){}
